Nicks
~~~~~

It was surprisingly difficult to find a desciption of what constitutes a valid nick on Freenode. Asked the friendly folks on `#freenode <irc://chat.freenode.net:6667>`_ and had the answer a few minutes later.

    nickname   =  ( letter / special ) *8( letter / digit / special / "-" )
    and special is "[", "]", "\", "`", "_", "^", "{", "|", "}"

Nicks can be from 2 - 16 ASCII characters long. These characters are allowed:
